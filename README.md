## Architecture

The organization of my project directory differs slightly from the example format so that I may follow the official [Standard Directory Layout]((https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-standard-directory-layout.html)) guidelines given by the Apache Maven Project.
In my experience, organizing my project by this standard format prevents Maven build issues.
