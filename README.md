## Architecture

The organization of my project directory differs slightly from the example format so that I may follow the official [Standard Directory Layout]((https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-standard-directory-layout.html)) guidelines given by the Apache Maven Project.
In my experience, organizing my project by this standard format prevents Maven build issues.

## Environment

## Executing the Web Application

>  [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Execution requires a Windows machine with a recent installation of Java.

#### Step-by-Step Instructions
1. Download [calculatorApp-1.0.jar](target/calculatorApp-1.0.jar) from the target folder OR clone this GitHub repository
2. Open Windows Command Prompt at the directory with the calculatorApp-1.0.jar download
3. Enter the following into the Command Prompt:

       java -jar calculatorApp-1.0.jar
4. Open a web browser and go to http://localhost:8080

*If this process fails, please ensure your installation of Java is up to date.*
